A27117	90	we cannot continue to urbanize our environment and expect the planet to cope with the ever increasing pollution
A27117	91	rural poverty is a massive problem in many parts of both the developed and developing world. cities provide economies of scale and provide new income opportunities for displaced rural people.
A27117	92	urbanization results in environmental degradation
A27117	93	people need houses, we need industry to give people a living and we need places for shopping and leisure. there is still plenty of green field land in the uk - we just need to utilize it better

D01001	1	Print media is more trustworthy because once the news is published, it cannot be modified or deleted. Whereas in digital media, we can modify or delete the contents. So, those who run the newspapers and magazines will be extra careful while publishing the news or articles. Hence, print media is more trustworthy than digital media.
D01001	2	It is not eco-friendly, since print media requires paper that is harvested from trees.
D01001	3	Print media is just one-way communication. It gives information to the public, but consumers cannot share their opinions. Even though some newspapers publish readers’ mails, it is not user-friendly.
D01001	4	Print media cannot target a specific audience, whereas digital media can show different ads to a different type of audience and thereby can generate more revenue.
D01001	5	Several online news websites are bringing their print versions to reach more consumers and establish credibility.
D01001	6	Print media is not helpful for some people with disabilities, whereas digital media has accessibility options in general. For example, digital media helps people with visual impairment by providing audio versions of the content.
D01001	7	When we read newspapers, there will be no distractions and hence we can totally focus on it. This is an advantage of print media over digital media, which can distract us a lot with its various options and clickable advertisements.
D01001	8	These days, studies and work involve screen time for many. So, print media is like a break and relief. Moreover, at present more and more people are opting for Digital Detox time. Print media is super useful for them.
D01001	9	Following Print media can save a lot of time because all the content is compiled in a newspaper or magazine.
D01001	10	Still, some remote areas in India have limited access to the internet. Print media is a blessing for them to know the latest happenings around the world.
D01018	1	Taking unilateral decisions is sometimes important because dialogue and all the other ways did not work till now.
D01018	2	Bifurcation can result in better governance and more efficient administration. It can also help in tackling terrorism.
D01018	3	This may set as a bad example for the succeeding governments. Downgrading the status of a state to union territory can be taken as a precedent. For example, If the state government is ruled by a different party from the center, and if the center wants to take control of the state, this incident can be shown as an example to do so.
D01018	4	This step may be used by separatists to influence youngsters in acting against the Indian government.
D01018	5	Moreover, tourism and film shootings faced obstacles due to the militancy in J&K. Now as Ladakh is a separate union territory, it can boost its economy.
D01018	6	Bifurcation of Jammu & Kashmir was done without consulting the people and local leaders of the state. Moreover, there was a blackout of communication channels and media, so they had no possibility of expressing their views. This sends a wrong message to the people and is against the democratic principles of India. It is also against the federal principles, which guarantees rights to states. Moreover, on the same day, Article 370 was revoked, so this may make local people feel like they have no say in the decisions that impact them.
D01018	7	Further division of Ladakh into 2 districts – Leh and Kargil on a religious basis is facing criticism from the local people. This move could have been avoided to preserve unity.
D01018	8	When Jammu&Kashmir were one state, Ladakh felt alienated. Its ecological and cultural uniqueness was not given enough importance and was often neglected because the culture of Ladakh and J&K are very different. Thereby people of Ladakh are demanding bifurcation for a long time. Ladakh’s local leaders feel that their region was politically neglected by the administration at J&K. So, bifurcating is a good decision.
D01072	1	We were champions of hockey even when we were not independent. We have won Olympic 8 gold medals in Hockey, the highest in any sport. We had a glorious past, and we should work towards restoring it. Making cricket a national game may overshadow hockey.
D01072	2	Apart from the raw passion, the money and fame that follows are blinding. Unlike other players of other sports, the cricketers even at the junior levels earn handsomely, which is also a motivating factor that this game ensures financial security provided you play well.
D01072	3	India has been performing outstandingly well in cricket for the past 20 years or so. It is the most popular sport in India. Children are madly passionate about it, people are deeply involved in the game, and there is a cricket critic in every Indian house. The BCCI has been successful in brilliantly marketing and encouraging the game as well. BCCI is the richest cricket board in the world and the richest sports controlling authority in India. No sports authority has managed their game so well in India as compared to BCCI. We have won 3 World Cups, 2 Champion Trophies, and many more prestigious tournaments.
D01072	4	Cricket basically originated in England and gained popularity in colonial countries as the English masters used to play. The fine Englishmen used to bat all day and the tiring bowling work was done by the locals of the colonies. This game is a sign of the presence of colonialism.
D01089	1	Crony capitalists are able to get away with just about anything. They enjoy the full support of money and the government in all their endeavors. Their decisions may even cause the economy to suffer adversely.
D01089	2	Crony capitalists get an advantage over their competitors due to support from the government. Simple examples of the undue advantage they get may be in the form of easier loan sanctions, loan approvals despite adverse credit ratings, easier land acquisition, out-of-turn property registration, tender approvals without any past record of performance, etc. This ruins the reward system of the markets. A monopoly gets established in the markets which prevents new players from entering the markets. This leads to lesser entrepreneurial activity in the country. Decreased entrepreneurial activity leads to lesser job opportunities and borrowing.
D01089	3	Crony capitalism has led to India having the world’s worst non-performing loan ratio. Lenders gave away loans to unworthy entities over the years despite knowing their credit backgrounds. The current amount of bad debts is approximately equal to INR 9 lakh crore and is expected to increase by INR 2 Trillion next year. The banks are left with no other option but to take huge haircuts (sometimes even as high as 65%) on the loans recovered. Taxpayers' money is often used to bail out these banks in order to save the economy.
D01089	4	An atmosphere of decreased lending is created and, in turn, the economy gets slowed down. As can be seen in India, entrepreneurial activity is extremely low. Job opportunities are extremely low today. India is experiencing the highest levels of unemployment in the last 4 decades. The Indian economy has been posting 7%+ GDP repeatedly but yet the common people are suffering while the rich are getting richer.
D01117	1	As women face violence because of their gender, they need special laws to protect them. But, in general, men do not face physical harassment just because of their gender.
D01117	2	In India, it is very difficult for women to go to police stations to report crimes against them. Men’s commission may further deter them from approaching courts.
D01117	3	If a woman is a victim of any sort of harassment and is in a distress, society will more likely to help her. But the same is not true for men. If a man is a victim of domestic violence or sexual harassment, there is no single government entity he can approach to. Moreover, society may make fun of him for being weak. This is the reason married men are twice likely to commit suicide when compared to married women. To address these gender stereotypes and discrimination, there is a need for 'National commission for Men'.
D01117	4	As per the 2011 census, India has a 51.47% male population. India has a 'Ministry for women & child development', but none of the government entities is working on men’s rights. As India is a democratic country, it is unfair to neglect people based on their gender.
D01117	5	With better and more stringent mechanisms and laws in place to deal with sexual harassment, rape cases, and domestic violence cases, unfortunately, there have been instances of misuse of the laws to cause harm to innocent men. Setting up a Ministry of Men would at least give such men a chance to make their case. This, in no way, is meant to undermine the case for the protection of women.
D01117	6	It has been observed that in countries where the sex ratio is skewed against women, crimes against women increase drastically. As can be easily seen in India, crimes against women have been on the rise. Most horrific of all, crimes against minor girls have increased drastically since 2012. This paints a very grim picture of our society as a whole. The highest GDP growth rate amounts to nothing if our society itself is corrupted to the extent that it is right now. India has been a patriarchal society for centuries. To make a shift to an egalitarian society for women in every aspect of life, Indian men need to be re-educated and rehabilitated with the new norms.
D01117	7	Drug addiction is a menace that has plagued Indian youth in recent years. The majority of drug addicts are males. A ministry of men can help solve the problem of why capable male youth of the country are resorting to such self-destructive activities.
D01129	1	The residents get to have a community of their own. They can interact, make friends and enjoy themselves together.
D01129	2	Retirement homes are usually built in such a manner that injuries due to domestic accidents are minimized. Skid-proof tiles, arthritis-friendly fittings, etc are some of the features that they exhibit.
D01129	3	The elders get to live a life of dignity. They do not feel like a burden on any of their relatives. They are also treated respectfully in their own community as compared to being ill-treated by their relatives.
D01129	4	Medical facilities are readily available at retirement homes making it easier for the elderly in case of severe emergency or even the slightest discomfort.
D01129	5	At well-maintained retirement homes, they get individual care for their condition, be it any kind of sickness, disability, or medical condition. Nurses, caretakers, etc make sure that they are comfortable.
D01129	6	Any retirement home worth spending the rest of your life in is quite costly for a middle-class family.
D01129	7	Senior living homes or retirement homes may sometimes feel secluded from the outer world.
D01129	8	The residents may feel a lack of connectivity with their family members. Being away from the family for too long can sometimes be depressing for some people.
D01129	9	What caregivers and nurses cannot substitute is the feeling of being loved by your family members. For them, it’s only a job and there is no connection at a personal level.
D01129	10	The residents might be ill-treated by the authorities at the retirement homes.
D01150	1	Though our constitution guarantees equal rights to women in all aspects, the mentality of people didn’t change. There have been several cases of rapes, domestic violence, dowry, acid attacks, etc. that led to the formation of several strict laws for women's safety. In 2011, India was ranked as the fourth most dangerous country for women in the world (in 2018 India was ranked the most dangerous country for women) and worst among the G20 nations when it comes to women's security.
D01150	2	Women are lagging far behind men in education. Fewer girls attend school as compared to boys and also their dropout rate is high. According to the 2011 census, the data literacy rate of women is 65.46% as compared to 82.14% of men. This difference is alarming.
D01150	3	Though the government and courts are trying to bring equality to society, it has to be the people’s mindset that needs a change. And in big and developed cities of India, this positive change is quite visible but in villages and small towns, there is a lot of gender inequality to be dealt with.
D01153	1	As per Article 370, people of other regions cannot buy land or settle in Jammu & Kashmir. This is acting against the development of the region. By abolishing article 370, teachers, doctors, and other professionals can settle there bringing better facilities. And also industries can be set up in the region and hence Jammu & Kashmir can be economically developed.
D01153	2	By abolishing this article, the government can act tough against the terrorism present in the region.
D01153	3	Many laws such as The prohibition of the Child Marriage Act, and women’s reservations were not applicable to Jammu & Kashmir, because of the provisions of Article 370. All laws of India should also be applicable to J&K.
D01153	4	People of J&K have a feeling that settlers from other regions will change the demography of the region. So, due to the abolition of article 370, they may protest against the central government.
D01153	5	Citizens of Jammu & Kashmir are facing so much struggle because of many reasons such as the fight between India and Pakistan, the constant presence of troops, the unemployment crisis, etc. So if the special status is also removed, they may feel like their voice is suppressed.
D02003	1	Urbanization results in increased population density, which leads to pressure on resources such as land, water, medical professionals, and police.
D02003	2	As more people keep coming to urban areas, there will be more supply of human resources than demand, hence the wages will decrease. Hence many people work so hard for a meager income.
D02003	3	More population causes a burden on the government and hence it will be difficult to ensure the quality of life for all.
D02003	4	Due to high demand, land prices, housing prices, and rents will increase drastically. Not everyone can afford the prices. Those who can afford to have to spend a large part of their income on housing. The people who cannot afford to rent in urban areas are forced to live in slums with substandard housing and poor sanitation facilities, which negatively affects the health of people living there.
D02007	1	Cooked food may get wasted in case of the wrong estimation of hungry people in the area.
D02007	2	India ranked 101 out of 116 countries in the Global Hunger Index, 2021. Many people in India are undernourished and are sleeping on an empty stomach. As the supreme court mentioned, it is the duty of the welfare state to ensure that all the citizens have food to eat. By establishing community kitchens throughout the country, we can ensure that everyone has access to nutritious food.
D02007	3	Due to the pandemic, many people lost jobs, especially those who are working in the informal sector. So, now community kitchens are more needed than ever.
D02007	4	Tonnes of food grains rot every year at the Food Corporation of India (FCI). By supplying the food grains to the community kitchen, the waste of food grains can be prevented, and instead that can be used to feed hungry people. 
D02007	5	Many people, especially youngsters are willing to volunteer. But not many have access to volunteer options nearby. Once community kitchens are set up, many people will happily volunteer and will donate supplies too.
D02007	6	Implementation of community kitchens requires continuous efforts from the government. Many such initiatives from the government are neglected after a few months.
D02043	1	Initially, India faced issues such as vaccine shortage, lack of availability of vaccines in remote places, etc. But now after solving all these challenges, the main challenge now is to vaccinate those who do not want to be vaccinated. So, by enforcing legal measures such as compulsory vaccination, we can achieve 100% vaccination. The government can help them in dealing with their fears by keeping them for a longer time in vaccination centers while having a medical team by their side.
D02043	2	If the world did not achieve 100% vaccination, a lot of new variants will be created. So, it is important to vaccinate all to reduce the possibility of new strains.
D02043	3	Many people are not taking vaccination due to the rumors that are being spread by anti-vaxxers using social media. Taking action against these rumor creators is much better for improving the vaccination rate rather than enforcing compulsory vaccination.
D02043	4	Widespread awareness campaigns involving local people can help in overcoming vaccine hesitancy. Innovative and creative advertisements can encourage people to take the vaccination. These methods will be much more effective than legal measures.
D02059	1	In the hope of becoming rich, many people are burning money to buy overhyped digital art. Many will lose money when people lose interest in buying these NFTs. Some people are saying that NFTs are a bubble that is going to burst.
D02059	2	NFTs help artists sell their paintings, music, etc. for a good amount of money, which may not be possible before NFTs.
D02059	3	Whenever an NFT was sold or bought, the transaction consumes lots of electricity. This huge energy consumption is a serious issue because we are already fighting against climate change.
D02059	4	Hackers are stealing NFTs. And they are also stealing cryptocurrencies by sending malicious NFTs. Recently, hackers stole $150k worth of crypto from Twitch co-founder’s Fractal NFT project.
D03002	1	Drones are being used in many industries. They go to places where it is difficult for humans to go. For example, they can be used to deliver medicines quickly in hilly regions. Drones can be used to deliver food in times of natural calamities. Not just delivering food, using drones, rescue teams can find people that are stuck and can save them. So, drones can save lives.
D03002	2	Drones can be misused to stalk, vandalize homes, and for doing many other anti-social activities. There have been many incidents, where drones posed security threats.
D03004	1	Earlier, there was a threat of coercion and booth capturing. Some people used to threaten voters to vote for a particular candidate. Using CCTV cameras prevented this to a large extent. But now, e-voting has the same vulnerability. It is difficult to provide security to everyone in their homes.
D03004	2	It is prone to hacking. Even when we are using advanced technologies to make it more secure, hackers are also using new technologies and new methods to hack. It may also raise privacy issues. Even though blockchain guarantees anonymity, there is a possibility of a hack to know who voted for whom. Hackers may even hack smartphones to know the details.
D03004	3	Still, the digital divide exists in not just India but in the entire world. So, this may create new inequalities where some people can cast their vote from home and some others have to visit a polling station.
D03016	1	Children are made to work in industries with hazardous chemicals, and machines under harsh weather conditions, resulting in physical casualties and many severe diseases. 
D03016	2	Due to a lack of education and proper guidance, they get influenced by criminals and take shortcuts to become rich, and end up committing crimes at a tender age. The rates of juvenile crime cases are increasing day by day in India.
D03016	3	The number of harassment and child abuse cases has drastically increased in the last few years most of them are sexual abuse cases occurring with girls and boys aged below 15.
D03016	4	Childhood is the most important phase for the development of physical and emotional abilities. The problem of child labor is stealing childhood from many children. Mere making laws to prevent it doesn’t solve the problem. Implementation of the laws on a war footing is needed.
D03025	1	There are other options available like ‘Hyperloop’, which is more feasible and less costly. India could have provided her scientific expertise and given land holding to the research and development of these technologies.
D03025	2	The cost of the project is more than 1.5 lakh crore for a single rail line. Instead, this money can be invested in the development of the present railway system which is a case deserving more immediate attention, seeing the recent rail accidents in India. 
D03025	3	Bullet trains will decrease travel time hence increasing connectivity as well as ease the means of transport, hence eliminating regional differences. Moreover, bullet trains could prove to be an important means of transportation for long-duration journeys for the middle-class population of the country.
D03025	4	The question of economic feasibility is being raised as the project is too costly at Rs. 1.5 lakh crores. However, similar questions were raised during the introduction of telecom services and the commission of Maruti. As the service expanded and the demand increased, not only did the respective areas become profitable, but the prices also went down outrageously.
D03025	5	High-Speed Railways (HSR) in India are going to be a new step toward a technologically advanced nation that would help in the development of infrastructure as well as reduce unemployment.
E01010	1	There has to be a general awareness that the real price of throw-away products and mass-produced foods is paid in the long run and that continuing down the current path will lead to more problems than having to adjust one's consumer behavior. 
E01010	2	The idea of a circular economy could help us to tackle the problem of overconsumption and overproduction of waste. 
E01010	3	such an approach to be successful must be implemented in each EU country to have visible results and help change the habits of both EU citizens and the private sector. And it has to be long-term promoted and funded. Can we do it?
E01010	4	Education is key. School curricula could help have more responsible consumption. 
E01010	5	The national governments with the help of the EU should be able to set up “taxes” or “rewards” as in Sweden or Denmark to encourage citizens to recycle.
E01011	1	Not taking climate impact and biodiversity loss into account makes it difficult for businesses to move towards a more virtuous system. 
E01011	2	It is important to take into account all negative consequences in the balance sheet of companies so that everything that is taken/destroyed/polluted from nature is accounted for.
E01017	1	What does it mean to have a mere CO2eq. indicator? That's utter nonsense as there are many more impact categories.
E01041	1	e-coins can be easily blocked, erased, or stolen. 
E01041	2	Cryptocurrencies are causing massive damage to the environment due to large energy consumption.
E01041	3	all these alternations of Bitcoin are copies of the one Ponzi scheme - you pay for 'fiat' as these e-coins are backed only by the faith of e-believers willing to own it
E01041	4	the second EU starts banning cryptocurrencies, it will start getting compared to totalitarian regimes (even more than now).
E01041	5	everyone should have a right to own cryptocurrency.
E01046	1	Microplastics are everywhere nowadays: in the water we drink, the food we eat, and the air we breathe. It is said that we consume a credit card's worth of plastics every week. This must stop before we consume an apple's worth of plastics every week. 
E01046	2	Not many consumers are aware of how many of their products contain microplastics because producers deliberately hide this fact by only referring to the chemical names of microplastics on labels. 
E01046	3	In order to in parallel raise consumer awareness about which products contain microplastics, the EU should introduce a requirement for mandatory labels on packages of products containing microplastics warning consumers of the presence thereof.
E01046	4	the solution must be a combination of EU regulation of microplastics, producers proactively replacing microplastics with natural elements with the same functions, and consumers making more informed choices to reduce demand from products with microplastics.
E01066	1	giving nuclear energy a green label will encourage the flow of financial resources across the EU toward environmentally sustainable activities
E01066	2	Nuclear energy can be considered sustainable because it is cheap and can be predicted for decades, and the price of power produced by nuclear power plants is not affected by changes in the price of natural gas or other energy carriers.
E01066	3	Nuclear energy use helps to avoid the release of thousands of tons of carbon dioxide and other harmful air pollutants every year, which contribute to the development of acid rain, smog, lung cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.
E01085	1	It is absolutely ridiculous to be spending money on these climate disastrous practices. The EU is nowhere close to keeping with the Paris Climate Agreement and is still funding unsustainable practices left and right.
E01085	2	The agricultural policy (CAP) accounts for about a third of the EU budget, €58 billion. This vast amount is flowing into completely outdated agricultural subsidies that promote and support an economic model dating back to the 1960s, which produces vast amounts of CO2. It is not only the steel, coal, car, cement, and other industries that contribute to global warming, it is also agriculture that is not reformed and continues to operate under regulations that protect vested interests rather than really support building a sustainable model. 
E01087	1	a Europe-wide uniform high-speed train network will lower plane traffic
E01087	2	a Europe-wide uniform high-speed train network will create an affordable European travel card to make traveling by train possible for the majority of European citizens.
E01089	1	There is scientific consensus on the fact that fish have the ability to feel pain and emotions such as fear. 
E01089	2	Fishing with live bait creates the risk of introducing and spreading invasive species, as well as the risk of transmitting diseases to wild fish. 
E01095	1	Garbage trading is typical of capitalism in private hands. Not only among exporters in the EU but also among the recipients distributed worldwide in third countries.
E01095	2	Waste produces negative environmental impacts in the recipient state. 
E01095	3	Exported trash is burning for months suffocating local people and wildlife.
E01095	4	Exported trash is often flushed to the sea by rain, thus polluting rivers on the go.
E01122	1	It's an empty slogan that doesn't reflect the core principles and true nature of European integration. Member States and their peoples are the basis. 
E01122	2	The random radical constitutional foundation of the EU only riles hesitant populaces without solving a particular problem. 
E01122	3	Less centralization in Brussels, more flexibility.
E01122	4	This is the only way that European values and democracies can survive the challenges ahead of us. Europe has two kinds of countries: small countries and small countries that haven't realised they are small yet. If we want to protect European sovereignty we need to keep integrating. The other option is to sell our countries to China and Russia or turn them into American colonies. 
E01122	5	No Federations, no centralization. We need to respect the European diversity. 
E01122	6	A federal republic in which all European peoples can live according to their own way of life and identity. Yes, that would help!
E01122	7	We must recognize that in the face of climate change, a refugee crisis, a past financial crisis, and now a pandemic, it is no longer sufficiently well-welcomed to present the interests of Europeans
E01122	8	The individual member states are too weak to cope with the major challenges of our time. 
E01122	9	If the EU intends to survive it has to integrate less.  Go back to the EEC. Instead of building a static bloc, it should increase competitiveness.
E01122	10	Lately, the EU has appeared weak and non-organized. For example, we have had no joint policy on how to handle the pandemic. Actions to deal with various problems often come too late. You cannot discuss solutions for years, which requires urgent action. 
E01122	11	Since the EU was developed, little progress and much stagnation have been made.  
E01122	12	The EURO has been a disaster. It has impoverished the EU and turned the EU into a fighting Union. 
E01124	1	We need to realize the truth of what's out there. Truthful and open research without bias or stigmas.
E01125	1	I guess that after the recent Russian attack on Ukraine, the idea of the EU defense and the army seems much more feasible and convenient.
E01134	1	There is little or no educational, conservational, research, or economic benefit derived from wild animals in traditional circuses that might justify their use and the loss of their ability to behave naturally as wild animals. 
E01134	2	In circuses, wild animals in circuses are destined to a life of physical abuse and mental torture.
E01134	3	The public can still attend numerous successful contemporary circuses that do not use wild animals and continue to enjoy the experience, of varied and exciting human acts.
E01134	4	Circuses are traveling entertainment services moving around Europe, and performing wild animals are transported across Member States, where circuses pose a severe public safety threat.
E01138	1	The broadcasting license on the European level can enable the creation of media champions that will be able to compete with media champions in other parts of the world (CNN, BBC, Al Jazeera...)
E01138	2	The broadcasting license on the European level can project European soft power beyond its borders. 
E01138	3	The broadcasting license on the European level can help avoid misinformation, meddling, and foreign influence more than smaller networks, which would ensure a better quality of the content.
E01138	4	The broadcasting license on the European level will unite European markets for film and music.   
E01138	5	A common broadcasting license would have an effect on the EU countries experiencing democratic backsliding
E01144	1	I agree, it would agile bureaucracy and it would benefit both citizens and institutions.
E01144	2	As we are sometimes required to move for work (mobility of workforce) it would be great, if all EU countries accept a language or format of official documents.
E01153	1	EU needs to take advantage of the high quality of high school education to enable the best young people to develop their talents for the benefit of society.
E01153	2	Research, and in particular open-ended curiosity-driven research, is the essential solid bedrock on which a better and more innovative Europe can be built.
E01153	3	Without increased financing of research, we will lack a firm evidence base.
E01153	4	Without increased financing of research, the industry will miss out on disruptive technologies.
E01153	5	Without increased financing of research, the movement toward better political, social and legal structures will falter.
E01153	6	No science means war, hunger, material, and moral poverty.
E01153	7	EU is the house of peace but without knowledge and without research, peace is in danger.
E01153	8	EU is the house of peace but without knowledge and without research, peace is in danger.
E01164	1	Europe is slipping badly behind in many technological sectors. More investment by both the public and private sectors is needed to solve this problem.
E01164	2	Without decades of basic research to build on, the development of not one but several vaccines against Covid-19 to battle the current pandemic would have been impossible. 
E01164	3	Massive cuts to the research budget are leading to a tremendous brain drain and are destroying Europe as the home of scientific excellence. 
E01164	4	To face future crises – from climate change over cancer to multi-resistant bacteria - we need a strong fundament of open research that will provide the solutions when needed.
E01168	1	Feeding or dressing man is no longer an acceptable excuse with the state of knowledge of the “modern” world.
E02077	1	All of Europe has to pay income tax & VAT, except for the Eurocrats. In Belgium, you have to pay 50 % of your salary to the state, unless you work directly for the EU. Is this fair? No, of course not! It is time to make Europe fairer in a very practical and direct way, by abolishing tax exemptions for European politicians and staff. 
E02078	1	NGOs are often America's way of interfering in European elections. NGOs must be policed more vigilantly to prevent America from interfering in our elections.
E02079	1	Migration is an ongoing phenomenon. Destroy what was built to face it wouldn't solve it.  We need to have a shared strategy for its management or it will continue without any control.  I'm not saying that policies should remain as they are or that we should accept everyone coming to Europe. I'm just saying that we must have a shared policy, in order to move in the same direction on this important topic.
E02079	2	We must do the exact opposite, otherwise, each country will take all immigrants and push them to the north. Spain, Italy, and Greece do not have the means to stop migrants at their borders.
E02079	3	With the ongoing population explosion, in particular in Africa and the ME, the EU has no other option than a total ban on immigration. Exceptions can be made for temporary stays and for experts the EU needs. 
E02079	4	The EU attempts to gain power over the EU members on the distribution of immigrants.  It thereby cuts the rights of the EU members.  
E02079	5	The EU is also weak in dealing with NGOs and in dealing with countries that refuse to take back their illegal immigrants.  Indeed, the EU cannot be trusted because of a lack of ambition or lack of competence.
E02079	6	The NGOs are committing the EXACT same crime Lukashenko is guilty of: Organizing mass migration and directing it toward Europe is aggression and an act of hybrid warfare. 
E02085	1	Creating new funds will only benefit some banks. 
E02086	1	Just another pile of debt with more bureau-crazy.  Forget it.
E02086	2	Creating a European Wealth Fund will help to foster European growth and unity.
E02086	3	A European Wealth Fund should be created to serve as the nexus for strategic investments in European and international economic activity aligning with European fundamental rights, norms, and values and the global green and digital transition.
E02089	1	We should focus more on human welfare. Currently, waste sorting and recycling are degrading human exploitation in sweatshops. 
E02089	2	The market will not create those jobs, therefore it must be done by the public, at the European level as well as national, regional, and local levels.
E02091	1	The 2000-year-old European culture is rapidly disappearing.  Add the mass immigration of unskilled people to it and we have to conclude that the EU is on a kamikaze flight.  Young people have to be encouraged to start a family. For example by financial support for housing or paying off student loans.
E02092	1	No person should really earn an income from owning land itself, because it is not the result of human labor. Planet Earth is the common inheritance of humanity, why should any human have the right to take a piece of ground and demand payment from someone else for the privilege of using it? The land exists independently of the land owner.
E02092	2	A land tax would eliminate land speculation because the increase in ground rent would go away in tax.
E02094	1	Having all workers working in private enterprise, irrespective of size, share equity in the company they work for by default would motivate higher worker dedication, overall operating and productive efficiencies, improved quality, profit sharing, reduced corrupt practices in management through stricter accountability, work satisfaction - a win-win situation for all.
E02120	1	It's about time we stop using animals for entertainment purposes!
E02120	2	It's about time we stop using animals for entertainment purposes!
E03021	1	Not a good idea. We already have a system that runs refugee camps in other countries, the UNHCR. Why reinvent the wheel? How would EU camps be any different from UN camps?
E03021	2	If Europe is going to have concentration camps again, they should be in Europe, in plain sight, for everyone to see.
E03021	3	We can't outsource our problems to third world countries.
E03021	4	Setting up inhumane camps by bribing local warlords is not the right way.
E03021	5	Agree. If the asylum seekers don't have to cross the Mediterranean to apply for it less of them will die trying and less human trafficking will take place.
E03021	6	Agree. Whoever is rejected won't be in the country and eat up resources that could be used to process others.
E03021	7	Good idea. These camps can be managed by the UN. The EU can send illegal immigrants to these camps. So they will not be on EU soil. From the camps they still can apply for asylum.
E03034	1	In addition to production and shipping, the score should also reflect the impact of the product's disposal. For example if the product requires to apply many different (toxic) chemicals for recycling, this should result in a worse score. 
E03034	2	Yes, but the problem is: Just because a product can be recycled, it does not mean that it always will be recycled. Let's assume that there would be a really climate friendly way to recycle batteries. Still people could throw those into landfills. How does the score deal with this?
E03036	1	Where do you think should be stored nuclear/radioactive waste please? Stored in glaciers will be problem (with melting etc.).
E03056	1	I think every region or city has the right to protect the citizens & the environment. If they all have to wait till the whole European Union is following & all existing cars which have been produced & sold under different conditions naturally fade out, they have no chance. 
E03062	1	I highly support this. As Jonathan Foer puts it in his book 'We are the weather': Changing our diet will not suffice to save the planet, but we won't save it unless we eat differently.
E03062	2	I understand your point and its importance, but as long as I have fangs in my mouth I will want to eat meat (like most people). You'd be better off suggesting more research into food printers. 
E03062	3	It's difficult to find a green idea I would not endorse however, promoting a plant-based lifestyle is the single most effective way any individual can make an instantaneous, meaningful and long-lasting impact.
E03062	4	A plant-based lifestyle does not demand a social standing, greater income or innate ability. It only requires a person's higher capacity to be compassionate, respectful and most of all dedicated to our environment's needs. Who wouldn't want such qualities to become our society's norm?
E03062	5	Even if you believe you are unable to follow a plant-based lifestyle you must appreciate the effectiveness and dedication to the environment of those individuals who do.
E03062	6	There is no reason other than egotism to be against such a proposal.
E03075	1	Nuclear energy is not safe and it is not green because of radioactive waste. It is only transitional. We have good conditions for sustainable green energy (solar, wind, hydro, bio-methane and their combinations).
E04004	1	Europe has signed the UN charta on human rights. Also, Europe has the resources to design a fair and safe migration system so that the death of refugees in the Mediterranean sea stops.
E04004	2	The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, especially article 14, states: 'Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.'
E04004	3	Living in Europe is not a human right. Illegal migrants are willing to break a law and risk their lives (and the lives of their families), while unable to undergo the proper legal and established process and paperwork.

E04009	1	We do need migrants for example to harvest our fruits and vegetables or take care of our elder and children. 
E04009	2	It is a human right to change the country you live in and to live in safe conditions.
E04009	3	The anti-immigration politics of the European Union make no sense and are against human rights. 
E04009	4	If countries, where migrants want to go, would spend the money on their own they would be rich and economies would run like hell. 
E04009	5	Immigrants should try on their own to improve the system in their homelands.
E04009	6	Immigrants cannot work because they don't speak the required language.

E04058	1	Pushbacks are not per se illegal. On the contrary, if someone tries to enter from a safe third country into the EU, there is no reason why the EU should grant an asylum procedure to that person, knowing well that someone who enter the EU once, will never leave, even if the asylum claim will be processed with a negative result. 
E04058	2	Pushbacks should be a core part of an effective border protection mechanism of the EU.
E04058	3	The EU allegedly values human rights, and so should respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pushbacks are clearly a violation of basic human rights.

E04068	1	Mass migration is a phenomenon that causes damage to nations: target countries and source countries.

E04073	1	We should develop adequate border protection. The border guards should be given the legal and practical means to carry out their duty. 
E04073	2	The human rights regulations should be adapted. They were written half a century ago when we did not have mass migration.

E04093	1	It has been proven in many studies,  that immigrants will not cost Europe money but enrich our economy, as well as in so many cultural ways. It will not cost Europe more than the profit they ultimately contribute
E04093	2	Refugees want to find a safe place in order to live. People are HUMAN.
E04093	3	I am ashamed that I am European right now. We are keeping refugees behind walls and on islands like savages. They don't want to run from their home country. Who are we ok to deny them the right to exist?

E04116	1	There are no laws protecting climate refugees nowadays. They are facing all kinds of abuse, violence, and aggression, even from officials at the borders!  
E04116	2	There are already 84 million climate refugees in the world and this number is growing every single day! Nobody is protected and tomorrow can become one of them.  We need to create new laws protecting climate refugees and value human life as the highest value.

E04135	1	This single migration policy should include that:  Brussels (EU) handles the paperwork and logistics. Including, detention, and deportation of illegal immigrants. 
E04135	2	This single migration policy should include that: Members decide about the admission of the migrant. The conditions of the visa. Members will also pay for the cost of immigration/integration.
E04135	3	Europeans should retain control of our homeland, just as everyone else should theirs.

E05006	1	'Fair' taxation is a vague concept. Taxes are complex and countries want to avoid double taxation.  Countries should be able to set their own taxes in a way that matches their spending and the needs of their citizens. I am against global taxes and against double taxation.
E05007	1	The technology-enabled economy of abundance without human exploitation you can endorse it. We should not hamper automation, instead, we should rethink morals about work. Let the robots do all the bad jobs and let human beings be free to pursue a creative and meaningful life
E05008	1	It appears that the European Union remains unable to take courageous decisions and that we still have to wait for a move from the US to adopt ground-breaking solutions.
E05008	2	Instead of stopping the evaporation of tax revenues, the governments of the EU decided to implement harsh austerity measures targeting health systems, education, the police, the defense, and scientific research.  This built up into systemic weaknesses that were only partly revealed during the Covid pandemic.  These poor political choices also led to social unrest and the endangerment of the EU through a loss of faith in the European project.
E05038	1	It would be a better idea to abolish the European Parliament. It has become an ideological Kabuki Theatre. The Commission should be entirely under the control of the sovereign member states, of course, who remain the masters of the treaties.
E05038	2	Nowadays the voice of the EU in foreign policy and security is weak because any EU-MS can veto any decision in the EU Council. We have seen this many times when the EU-MS have tried to find a common stance on foreign policy issues but one has been able to deter the will of all the other countries. This is not a democratic way.   The EU Council should be only an advisory group to EU Parliament, and the decisions should be made in the EU Parliament with a majority vote principle because they are directly responsible to the citizens of the EU through a truly European election. 
E05038	3	Let us make the EU a fully-fledged democracy. In the classic three powers of democracy (legislation, executive and judicial) there is no place for an institution like the European Council. All legislative power should go to parliament — the executive power should only go to the Commission. The European Council is still too much-misused by the larger member states of Germany and France to push through their agenda.
E05041	1	Absolutely all such attempts merely lead to new types of misinformation. People get excited and carried away. They might go into the project with a clear conscience hoping to 'defend the truth' but end up spreading fake news and defending the point of view they hold. As Churchill said, 'the truth is so important that it has to be protected by a bodyguard of lies.'  The good news is that people are adjusting to the new reality of ever-growing, all-pervasive misinformation by evolving a bullshit detector.
E05065	1	Veto rights for individual member states run the risk of blocking social progress.
E05065	2	The veto is rarely used, but when it is, it is almost always thoroughly justified. No, we must preserve the member state veto.
E05065	3	Requiring unanimity to pass legislation over certain topics is a terrible idea because it gives the opportunity to a single country to block a reform because they think they could get a better deal, meaning it's impossible to find compromises, as a country could always veto the legislation if they don't get exactly what they want. This makes the EU slow and hard to reform.
E05065	4	Qualified voting is enough, if the need arises, to ‘protect’ the interests, preferences, and ideals of all Member-States. Unanimity leads to blackmail and/or deleterious impasses, and stalemates. We all have regrettable situations. Never again.
E05086	1	In Germany, a lot of company cars are not for business use but are offered to employees as incentives in order to use tax benefits and avoid the cost of payments to the social security system (in particular in the financial sector). This creates an incentive to buy heavyweight cars (be it combustion or electric automobiles). Also, e-vehicles consume rare resources for batteries like lithium and water increasing their weight. Therefore tax / social security benefits should only refer to the strict use of business reasons and not for cost avoidance to the disadvantage of the social security or tax system. Finally, this money should be invested in public infrastructure and public transport. 
E05086	2	I would suggest a general sustainability tax for all products, services & actions where cars could be taxed according to their environmental impact both concerning GHG emissions and local air pollution. Additionally, companies could lose tax benefits, if they use cars with big combustion engines. They could have tax reductions on electric vehicles or public transport tickets. 
E05086	3	If an employee receives part of his salary in the form of car and petrol, he will naturally use it more than he would otherwise, be less inclined to explore alternative ways of transport and opt for a bigger more polluting vehicle than what he really needs.
E05086	4	How would you know how many cases where companies and employees rely on their cars? How would you differentiate between needs and luxury?
E05091	1	This is a ridiculous proposition. No one is forcing you to take an unpaid internship. If companies are forced to pay for interns many just won't take any, which is a missed opportunity for people to learn skills. This is also difficult to regulate - will you ban voluntary work too? If not, what's the legal difference? Why should we not have the freedom to work as free interns for a company if we want to? How is this a good idea? This is just a restriction of freedom of choice.
E05091	2	Members should adopt measures to end unpaid Internships causes they are a form of exploitation of young people.
E05091	3	Young people may choose not to be exploited. My main problem with unpaid internships is that young people choose them because there are not enough entry-level paid jobs out there. Banning the practice will not change the underlying problem one bit. Reforms in the economy and education are the answer to your grievance, but those may not be solved by brute government force.
E05091	4	I am for the ban on internships that do not provide additional education and skills building, which are low-level jobs with no growth prospects. Such internships should be paid definitely. But I am against the ban on unpaid internships which provide other benefits - continuing education, mentoring, experience, skills building, upon which the highly paid job can be acquired in the future. High-quality unpaid internships have an impact on inequality - currently, they put poor people at disadvantage, and hence they are a factor in sustaining the poverty trap.
E05092	1	I think the EU should be in charge of this project, instead of national governments trying to link it up and everything should be financed with the EU budget.
E05092	2	A common train network would be a strong alternative to air- and even the car-travel if it is done properly with the right services and prices. For freight, this would significantly reduce truck distances and thus significantly reduce pollution. 
E05095	1	Today we live in a system where our public healthcare system is organized on a for-profit healthcare system, where we develop knowledge through taxpayer institutions and then let companies patent this knowledge for profit this has to change, we shouldn't let the greed of capitalists extort us, the EU should work to DISMANTLE all patents and make healthcare issues for all. The big pharma companies just drive up the price and charge prices, the EU shouldn't be just that to protect the interest of these companies like they do now.
E05095	2	I think we should decouple for-profit medicine from social issues. For-profit medicine is a good thing because it enables the most recent emergence of anti-aging/rejuvenation therapies (e.g. Science-intensive healthy longevity technologies: development and access), state governed health system currently is not pursuing such efforts, even more, currently there are no clinical tests allowed on therapies that target just aging, that is not associated with the specific aging-related disease. So, it should be laudable that businesses are doing this. 
E05100	1	Space mining may be neat science fiction, but I doubt it could ever become a commercially feasible activity. Aside from the environmental impact of launching vehicles into space, moving the mined materials to Earth would pose its own challenges. Entry into the atmosphere and arrival on Earth is dangerous. Having thousands of tons of mined matter go through this process seems destined to end up with frequent disasters.
E05109	1	This way all EU countries have access to a single database which will reduce paperwork and registration and provide immediate and informed service without the risk of complications, especially in regard to medical history. 
E05109	2	The EU Database should be made accessible for health studies and prevention in order to establish a European Basic Health care industry to overcome future pandemics.
E05109	3	No, just no. You have no right to demand that people put their entire medical history on a card readable by all countries. I would not put mine willingly.  Now a common health card for the EU, especially for insurance purposes and very important medical info (implants, transplants, severe allergies, blood type) yes. This makes sense, it does not infringe on privacy and everyone will agree to such a card. The moment you want a diagnosis and other stuff, that's where you are way off. You do know there are medical data centers and archives for this stuff? Hospitals can access this. But this is on a whole other level and should not be via card and not like this.
E05110	1	We have the possibility to choose between life and death. Life is for me 'Green up to cool down'. Death is for me allowing drought, extreme rain, and water scarcity to rule our lives and use big tech to somehow survive.
E05110	2	The main thing that needs to be done is educating people. Most people imagine dangerous poisonous chemicals when they hear the words GMO, which is far from the truth. The truth is, as you said, everything we eat (both plants and animals) was genetically modified, just with a slower, manual process. Being against GMOs is like being against a tractor. It's just a tool to speed up what manually takes hundreds of years.
E05110	3	We have the option to cure hunger in many places, increase the nutritional value of food, increase yields of manufacturing crops like cotton, and make plants resistant to emerging dangers of climatic change and globalization like predatory fungi or insects that harm crops or by making crops resistant to drought and heat waves. It’s sad to see that it has the rest of the world is moving forward, we in Europe have been misled behind in this respect.
E05110	4	Instead of GMOs, we could refocus on plant breeding - less risky than GMOs and less harmful to nature.  Also, I consider the statement: 'Humanity has been consuming genetically modified food for thousands of years.' misleading on purpose.  Genetically modified e.g. 500 years ago by whom? The soft way how to sell GMOs, which were created only in the few last decades (as far as it is known).
E05110	5	I am not completely against the use of GMOs in general, however, I am against the use of GMOs in the way they have been used until now. Proprietary patented seeds, leading to the increased power of the aggro lobby (and control of the whole food system); Seeds that cannot be reproduced by the farmer himself (posing health risks if done so); Seeds degrading soil and harming the environment due increased (intended) use of herbicides; Often oversold yield benefits, which might actually be lower compared to crops grown with agroecological principles. If we can make GMO seeds that will lead to decreased environmental impact (which is often the opposite of what is often happening now), seeds that will not put smaller farmers at disadvantage (e.g. forcing them to buy new seeds every year), then sure. But not right now.
E05117	1	Instead of banning anything, we should create better alternatives. When the high-speed rail line (320 km/h) between Strasbourg and Paris was opened, the number of flights between Stuttgart and Paris dropped dramatically, due to decreasing demand.
E05123	1	We can't allow our prisons to be filled with curious kids and desperate people. The use of drugs most often happens within safe quantities or as acts of despair caused by stress. We must ensure that victims of drug abuse be helped and integrated back into society, and not treat them as criminals. This can also free up law enforcement resources for more important offenses.
E05132	1	Nuclear waste can very certainly be buried in Europe. It might even be a pretty good place to do so! There is a lot of rock where you are completely safe from radiation on the outside and it is not geologically active at all!  Rather than putting it on an island where the inevitable break will distribute into the ocean, rain water, and around the entire world.  Radioactive rain - cool ;-) 
E05153	1	Unfortunately, vaccination has shown that it is unable to curb the contagion and therefore the spread of COVID-19. As a result, the EU COVID digital certificate is not able to guarantee the safety for which it was designed, demonstrating that it is primarily a tool of discrimination without real usefulness in containing contagion
E06001	1	Eurocrats must learn to act within the space afforded them by the European Treaties. Their grandstanding and theatrics are counterproductive
E06001	2	To begin with, stop using the labels “Europe” and “European” to name the EU institutions and initiatives. Do not forget that there are parts of the EU that are not part of Europe (the Spanish territories of the Canary Islands and the cities of Ceuta and Melilla, for example, belong to Africa from a geographical point of view); also, that there are parts of Europe that do not belong to Europe (the UK and Switzerland, to name only two); the EU and Europe are not synonyms: Cyprus is a member state of the EU, but 'if' geographically it is Europe, so must be Turkey.
E06021	1	Sexual offences and other serious crimes giving rise to psychological trauma must be excluded from limitation periods, as it is often impossible for victims to remember, let alone report, within the limitation period.
E06034	1	The rule of law varies from country to country, due to the fact that the concept developed in each country under the influence of local traditions. It's impossible, and superfluous to develop a uniform, EU-standard conception of the rule of law. 
E06035	1	'War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength'... and now censorship is free speech.
E06035	2	Who gets to decide what is 'hate speech'? Should the promotion of feminism be considered hate speech against men, or is only hate speech when you don't agree with someone?
E06037	1	We have made huge strides in ending sex-based discrimination in Europe. I think we can say that - but for a few details - this issue has been resolved.  'Gender' is a political concept made out of whole cloth. One is certainly free to imagine oneself to be a pink unicorn, but in the eyes of the law and society, he or she remains a man or a woman.
E06051	1	Racism is not a major problem in Europe. We need none of this Critical Race Theory nonsense.
E06066	1	The EU is not a country, but a free association of sovereign member states. Associations don't have constitutions. We have the perfectly fine EU Treaties as the foundational documents of the EU. They must be followed to the letter. 
E06072	1	We need to protect citizen sovereignty against bad players (be it the state, private entities, or other individuals). 
E06072	2	Facial recognition can and will be used against each of us by governments and corporations, based on who we are and what we look like. It will create societies of fear, anxiety, and suspicion.
E06072	3	Evidence shows that uses of biometric mass surveillance in Member States and by EU agencies have resulted in violations of EU data protection law, and unduly restricted people‘s rights including their privacy, right to free speech, right to protest, and not to be discriminated against. 
E06080	1	Yes, child abuse is a terrible crime, but there must be another way, which won't introduce surveillance of all. This surveillance would affect all people and violate their rights to privacy. It could (and probably would) end up abused by hackers, totalitarian regimes, etc. for censorship of free speech.  There is no such thing as a backdoor only for the good guys.
E06080	2	Chatcontrol is a harmful norm: it violates the secrecy of correspondence, increases the indiscriminate and unreasonable surveillance of citizens, allows governments and providers to experiment with tools that can be used for worrying purposes
E06080	3	Chatcontrol harms minors as well — it shifts attention to risks online, but abuses occur mainly offline: in families living in poverty and degradation; in the structures that should help them; in EU-funded refugee camps, or in countries with which we have diplomatic relations. 
E06096	1	Europe should choose a common language.  This can be the most spoken language by mother tongue, the most spoken language in Europe, or an international auxiliary language. The language most spoken mother tongue in Europe is probably German. The most spoken language in Europe is probably English. An international auxiliary language can be Esperanto. This then is a language that most people in Europe have to learn. Does the question remain what language will be spoken we talk with people outside of Europe? Will this be Esperanto or English? Next to that, I have the impression that English is basically also an international auxiliary language. 
E07155	1	Behavior and habits change slowly when a new direction is pointed out. People become less satisfied with changes the older they get. EU needs time for the goodwill of the people for permanent changes. Then a new EU foreign policy can be established. 
E07155	2	I envy no country that is not already very wealthy and has no view of any union. They will be a play ball between the greater powers. The EU is a necessity that is comparable with the worker's unions in the 1800 industrialization. Therefore the EU has to decide what role it wants to play in this coming world order.
E07160	1	You should endorse the creation of the European Army to defend the interests of European countries, fight against trafficking (humans, drugs, etc.), and be used as the arm of genuine European diplomacy.
E07176	1	I think it is extremely important to upgrade our relations with the former Eastern European countries and in that way move us in the right direction. It is now they need us the most. The area around the Black Sea has enormous potential. They have a growth zone that moves from western Europe to the east and at the same time a growth zone that moves from south China to the north.  
E07192	1	By focusing on the well-being of people, particularly disenfranchised people, the EU can arrive at a more complete and sustainable vision of global peace and prosperity.
E07275	1	It is neither in the interests of the EU nor Russia to split a long common history. The dialogue must never stop,  With respect and trade, interpersonal exchange, and further expansion of what almost ended in 2014. Here I am thinking of space exploration, and joint development of vehicles, aircraft, etc. Our time horizon must be long-term - back to where it once was and beyond - based on how the world changes. The economy of scale is completely dominant today. 
E07280	1	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity.
E08023	1	You owe the fact that you can drink your coffee in public to the people who got vaccinated and thus made the virus a little more manageable.
